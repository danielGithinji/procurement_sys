  -----------------------------PROCUREMENT SYS VERSION 0.1----------------------------


Am not sure whether there will be another version of this system, however it was made using
the codeigniter php framework.

Demo of the project is found at: http://procurementsys-gmanguru.rhcloud.com/

Username and Password is "demo".
Username and Password for the admin section is: "admin".

If the project takes more time than expected to load in the browser, give it a minute and once it loads it will run smoothly.

If you would like to download and install the project for yourself please follow the instructions below.

---INSTALLATION---

Included in the "procurementSys" folder is an sql file. The sql is made for a mysql 
database.

Import the sql file into phpmyadmin of your local or remote server. The database 
and the corresponding tables will be imported.

Copy the "procurementSys" folder to the root of your webserver, from there you will be
able to run it.

If you are able to successfully reach the homepage then the username and password is:"admin"
Once you open the admin account, click the "user management" link and view the user details
of the other users of the system who are able to access the system with their
own individual accounts.In order to access their accounts just use their username attribute
as both the username and password.

---Other Info---
The system was built for a procurement department of a university named TTUC whose name is
visible as a header throughout the system.
